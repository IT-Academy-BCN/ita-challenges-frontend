### 1. Description

The ITA-challenges-frontend project is built using Angular framework and reactive programming. It is an initiative designed specifically for students enrolled in the IT Academy program at Barcelona Activa.

The primary goal is to provide junior developers with hands-on experience in a real-world development environment,
real scenarios they may encounter in their future careers.

Simultaneously, developers collaborate to create a valuable learning tool for the ITA challenges application
dedicated to code and programming coding-challenges. This project involves tackling new features, addressing legacy code, resolving bugs,
and fostering teamwork. The emphasis is not only on technical proficiency but also on providing a holistic learning experience
for our students.

This project exists thanks to all the people who contribute.

### 5. FAQ's

- **Can I use any kind of AI as a help on this project? What is the best way to use AI?**

  - You are totally allowed to use AI in this project.

  - The best way to use AI is first to understand the problem you want to solve, then to choose the best algorithm to solve it, and finally to implement it in the application. Please, remember to double-check the AI's results and to test it in different scenarios.

- **Is there any diagram of architecture, a technical description or similar?**

  - Yes, you can find it in the [Wiki](https://github.com/IT-Academy-BCN/ita-challenges-frontend/wiki)

- **To contribute to this project, do I need make a fork?**

  - No, you don't need to fork of the project, you need to **clone** it.

  - Our workflow is based on a single repository model, where we create separate branches for each feature.
    Once a feature is completed, we initiate a pull request to merge the changes back into the main branch.

  - You can find how to do a clone in point 4 of the [Procedure](#procedure) section.

- **Do I need start up the project fully on my pc to start coding?**

  - No, you don't need to start up the project fully on your pc to start coding.
    You can start coding in your IDE and run the **App** class in the microservice you are working on.

- **What should I do if I discover a bug?**

  - If you discover a new bug, please create a new issue in the GitHub repository ita-challenges-backend repository
    describing the bug instead of trying to resolve it in another issue, and comment it to the product owner.

- **What are the coding standards for this project?**

  - The coding standards for this project are defined in the [GUIDELINES.md](GUIDELINES.md) file in the root of the repository.
    Please read and follow them before contributing.

- **How can I get help if I have difficulty contributing or understanding the project?**

  - Feel free to ask in the daily meetings or to your team if you find something hard to understand or if you encounter any other technical issues.
